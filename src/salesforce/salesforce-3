Given a file with list of commands followed by packages perform the commands and print the output


First line will state the number of commands
Each subsequent line will have the command in All CAPS followed by package names on which the command should be executed
END will always be the last command and it means the END of the file

DEPEND will be followed by a whitespace (space or a tab) with package names
the first package name depends on all the package names that follow it

eg. DEPEND A B C
A depends on B and A depends on C

DEPEND A B
DEPEND B A  //Not Allowed
Circular dependency is not allowed and must be caught by error control

INSTALL will install the package if not already installed along with all its dependecies
DEPEND A B
INSTALL A

Installing A
Installing B

REMOVE will remove the package and all its dependencies. The package will not be removed if any other installed pacakge is dependent on the package that needs to br removed
DEPEND A B
INSTALL A
REMOVE A

Removing A
Removing B

List will list all the installed packages
LIST
A
B
C
D


Expected output

For every command line countered
1) Echo the command line
2) DEPEND:- will not print anything after 1. unless there is a circular dependency ERROR
3) INSTALL will print either error, {packagename} already Installed or Installing {packagename}
4) REMOVE will print all the packages being removed in a new line
Removing A
Removing B

or error Cannot Remove A

5) LIST will print all the installed packages in a new line
A
B
C

6) END will print nothing
